      <div class="modal-body-links"><underline>odeandenspicker</underline> is a digital space, where you can find an ever-changing collection of absurd academic cheating methods, a seemingly trivial step by step instruction on how to not get caught and a debate on the ethics of cheating - held between two AI-chatbots.</div>
      <div class="modal-body-rechts">The content is sourced from online forums, subreddits and wikiHow guides, in the attempt to collect, remix, discuss and heighten its accessibility to a larger and different audience, than it would usually reach. Use it as a reminder for your own cheating charades in school. Take the content, try the methods yourself or use them to catch your students cheating. I don't care.</div>
      <div class="modal-body-links">It is about celebrating free and open online spaces, where users help each other out or voluntarily publish step by step instructions/solutions for every imaginable situation. Mostly it's an ode to academic cheating - we all did it!</div>

              <div class="text-methods">
                <div class="text-methods1">I put some info in braille on my pencil case. Of course, it meant I had to learn braille, which kind of defeated the object. Still, I now know basic braille.</div>
                <div class="text-methods2">Stretch a rubber band around a text book, write whatever you want on it, then when you take it off the textbook, it'll just look like scribble until you stretch it to see what's written. Spanish conjugations drove me to do some incredibly unethical things.</div>
                <div class="text-methods3">Start studying very hard 1 year before the exam. They will never know you cheated if you keep the notes in your brain.</div>
                <div class="text-methods4">There was a class that allowed you to bring one sheet of handwritten notes to exams. I knew a guy that created a font of his own handwriting and used to print the entire study guide onto a piece of notebook paper, front and back. He even set the font color to pencil grey and managed to get the margins and spacing exactly right to look like it'd been handwritten.</div>
                <div class="text-methods5">Bribe your teacher.</div>
                <div class="text-methods6">Write your little cheatsheet on a note card and tape it on a bandage, put a little bit of Betadine over the bandage so it lookes sort of bloody, then use those white tapes to place it on your forearm. When you want to use it just easily lift up one side of it, and if anyone ever noticed and questioned you, you can easily say "it hurts i'm just trying to see if it's bleeding".</div>
                <div class="text-methods7">College physics, girl with a really intricate tattoo on her leg wrote formulas in between the tattoo lines. Even looking closely you couldn't tell unless you knew what you were looking for. You could tell it was test day because she wore shorts.</div>
                <div class="text-methods8">My exams that used a graphic calculator (TI-84) required us to show the examiners a “proof of reset” screen before the papers started so instead of actually studying for my papers, I painstakingly redrew the “proof of reset” screen pixel by pixel in the TI-84s pixel art program and stored all my notes in it.</div>
                <div class="text-methods9">Wear corduroy pants. Use a razor blade to write notes in the material. If you rub it one way, the answers disappear in the fabric. Rub it the opposite way and the writing re-appears</div>
                <div class="text-methods10">I have not tried this method yet and I do not think anyone did but there is a certain level of hertz in sound that only people below a certain age can hear, there are devices who play that kind of sound so if the teacher is old they wont hear the sound, using that the students can communicate with morse code and such. I thought about this and this is not very practical or useful but its very creative so i thought sharing my idea.</div>
                <div class="text-methods11">Used a text file on one of the original iPods. Teacher was fine with "listening to music" during tests. Made my life so much easier lol.</div>
                <div class="text-methods12">My dad owned a graphic shop and he used to print books as well. Once he cut the cover on a vocabulary, print some essay in a paper very similar to the one to the dictionary and bind it together. It looked exactly like a dictionary. Sorry for my English, I am not mother tongue.</div>
                <div class="text-methods13">High school kids recreated a Snapple label where the nutrition panel on the back had all the answers, formulas, etc. only got caught because I'd never seen the flavor before and wanted to see how much sugar was in it.</div>
                <div class="text-methods14">My teacher shared with us a story about how since she allowed eating during her tests, one person pulled out a giant bag of M&Ms and ate a specific color corresponding to A/B/C/D. It was a two student duo and they only got caught when another student ratted them out.</div>
                <div class="text-methods15">One of my old teachers told us a story about a student who had rigged up a tiny scroll of paper in a wristwatch with notes written on it. He turned the scroll by winding the watch. He ended up getting caught because he was winding his watch so damn much during the exam, but the teacher loved the creativity.</div>
                <div class="text-methods16">As a student, we used to wear uniforms and leather shoes. As mine's a beater pair, i usually write on them with black ink pens. And when tests came, i angle it just enough to be seen by sunlight. Also, the edges of our uniform(button down shirts) are filled with formulas.</div>

            <div class="img-howto img1"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img1">1. Don't look suspicious. It's important to strike a balance between effectively getting your answers and not making it obvious.</div>

            <div class="img-howto img2"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img2">2. If you must look around, never hold your gaze in one place for longer than five to ten seconds.</div>

            <div class="img-howto img3"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img3">3. Don't aim too high. If you cheat your way into a perfect score, while everyone else is getting an unremarkable grade on the exam, you will draw attention to yourself.</div>

            <div class="img-howto img4"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img4">4. Dispose of the evidence. As soon as the test is over, ask to go to the bathroom (if you haven't already gone) to wash off or throw away any evidence of cheating.</div>

            <div class="img-howto img5"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img5">5. Always be aware of where the teacher is looking. No method of cheating is successful if the teacher is looking right at you while you frantically copy off of your cheatsheet.</div>

            <div class="img-howto img6"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img6">6. Write or print the information correctly. The font should always be clear to read (not too big, not too small; size 8 is usually the smallest font people can read).</div>

            <div class="img-howto img7"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img7">7. Partnering is always better than cheat sheets and the hard-to-prove methods are even better. Overall, the less evidence there is - the better it is for you.</div>

            <div class="img-howto img8"></div>
            <div class="text-howto text-img8">8. Don't brag about it. This may seem obvious, but it is something people do. You don't know who could tell the teacher.</div>

          <div class="überschrift4">CHAT GPT DEBATES CHEATING</div>

          <div class="sprechblase-mod sprechblase">Debate Moderator (MOD): Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to tonight's debate on the ethics of cheating in school. On one side, we have Alex, who argues that cheating is sometimes justifiable, and on the other side, we have Morgan, who firmly believes it is morally wrong. Let's begin with opening statements. Alex, you may start.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-rechts sprechblase">Alex (A): Thanks, Moderator. Look, school is just a game. I've always found ways to navigate the system, and if that means using a cheat sheet or peeking at someone's test, so be it. Life is full of shortcuts, and I'm just getting a head start.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-mod sprechblase">MOD: Morgan, your opening statement?</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-links sprechblase">Morgan (M): It's disheartening to hear that, Alex. Education is not just a game; it's about personal growth, learning, and integrity. 
            Cheating undermines the very essence of what education stands for.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-rechts sprechblase">A: Come on, Morgan! Life is tough, and sometimes you've got to do what you can to survive. If that means bending the rules a bit, so be it. It's not like anyone remembers their high school grades after a few years anyway.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-links sprechblase">M: Survival? Cheating is not survival; it's a betrayal of yourself. It's about taking responsibility for your actions and facing challenges with integrity. 
            By cheating, you're not just fooling the system; you're fooling yourself.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-mod sprechblase">MOD: Let's delve into the when and why. Alex, when do you think it's acceptable to cheat?</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-rechts sprechblase">A: Well, let's say you've got a huge workload, and the deadline is looming. Cheating can be a way to manage the stress and get through it. It's a means to an end.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-links sprechblase">M: Managing stress doesn't justify dishonesty. If you're overwhelmed, seek help from teachers or find healthier ways to cope. Cheating won't solve your problems; it will only make them worse.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-rechts sprechblase">A: (laughs) You sound like a motivational poster, Morgan. Not everyone has the luxury of a perfect life. Schools use a one-size-fits-all approach, so sometimes you've got to do what you've got to do.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-links sprechblase">M: It's not about a perfect life; it's about personal integrity. Life throws challenges at everyone, but cheating doesn't make them disappear. 
            It merely postpones the inevitable consequences.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-mod sprechblase">MOD: This debate is getting intense. Let's try to keep it civil. Alex, any final thoughts?</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-rechts sprechblase">A: Look, Morgan, not everyone is cut out for the academic grind. The benefits of cheating are obvious - improved grades in an environment where failure is not an opportunity for learning, but rather a badge of shame. Some of us need to find creative ways to succeed. If that means taking a few shortcuts, then so be it.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-links sprechblase">M: (frustrated) Success built on dishonesty is no success at all. It's a facade that will crumble eventually. True success comes from hard work, dedication, and facing challenges head-on. Suit yourself, A. But remember, you can't cheat life forever.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-rechts sprechblase">A: (dismissively) We'll see about that, Mr. High and Mighty. I'll take my chances.</div>
          <div class="sprechblase-mod sprechblase">MOD: Thank you both for your passionate arguments. This debate highlights the complexity of the issue and the divergent perspectives on the ethics of cheating in school.</div>
